# Predusk Frontend

This is the **frontend** for the Predusk Project, built with **ReactJS** and bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  

The frontend fetches user and project data from the backend API and displays it in a clean and responsive UI.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in **development mode**.  
Make sure your backend is running locally on port `4000`.  

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload if you make edits, and lint errors will appear in the console.  

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for **production** into the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.  

The build is minified and filenames include hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed.  

Before deploying, make sure the environment variable `REACT_APP_API_URL` points to your **production backend URL**:
